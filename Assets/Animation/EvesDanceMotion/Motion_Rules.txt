Thank you very much for using my conversion!

Please remember that this vmd-motion is not created by me.
This Dance-motion is basically only converted from an existing vmd-file.

I only have convert this motion and fixing some keyframe issues and create some animation keyframes new to make it smoother for VRChat Avatars.

-----------------------------------------------

Rules:
- DO NOT redistribute this motion-file(Only available on VRCMods)!
- DO NOT sell this motion-file!
- DO NOT put this file on a avatar-unity project and sell the motion with your avatar!
- DO NOT claim as your own!
- DO NOT upload this motion again to VRCMods inside a animation package!
- DO NOT manipulate this motion or change something on the animation!
- Enjoy! <3

Advice:
For correct work of motion, please be sure your avatar is already Unity-ready with Visemes(LipSync) and Eye Tracking.

Otherwise your Avatar is not able to make some gestures during the dance.

Take a look on this Tutorial: VRChat Eye tracking Avatar Tutorial.
